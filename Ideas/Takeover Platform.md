# Takeover Platform

A platform to help people take over leases from other tenants — solving the problem of tenants who need to get out of a lease early.

---

## Core Idea

Tenants who want out of their lease list it. Prospective tenants looking for a place (without waiting for a new lease cycle) browse and take it over.

---

## Problems It Solves

- Tenants stuck in leases they need to exit
- Renters who want shorter commitments or faster move-in
- Property managers lose less money vs. unit sitting vacant

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] How does landlord approval work in the handoff?
- [ ] Is there a fee model — flat rate, % of rent, subscription?
- [ ] Legal liability if the new tenant defaults?
- [ ] How is this different from existing subletting platforms?
