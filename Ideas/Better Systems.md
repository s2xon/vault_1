# Creating Better Systems

The core idea: run on an intentional 8-hour daily schedule and find small ways to improve it each day.

---

## The System

A structured daily schedule built around the most important blocks:

1. **Morning** — gym, then focused work/study session
2. **Midday** — errands, obligations, admin tasks
3. **Afternoon** — deep work block (school, side projects)
4. **Evening** — wind down, Anki, reflection

## Improvement Log

### 2026-02-23

- Woke up at 5am, hit the gym — good, but skipped a few sets rushing to get to studying
- Coffee shop study session in the morning
- Leasing office visit mid-morning broke up the flow
- Discord call in the afternoon disrupted the deep work block
- Anki session at the end of the day — finishing strong

**What to adjust:** protect the afternoon deep work block — Discord calls and distractions creep in too easily there.

## Ideas to Improve the System

- [ ] Set a hard cutoff for social/Discord until after deep work block
- [ ] Plan the next day's schedule the night before
- [ ] Track how many hours actually went to focused work vs. distractions
- [ ] Use Anki daily — never skip
