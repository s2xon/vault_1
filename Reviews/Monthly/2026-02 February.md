## What Got Done

**School**
- [[CS381 - Assignment 5|CS 381 HW 5]] — submitted, understood conceptually
- [[CS362 - Project|CS 362 project]] — set up
- CS Ethics assignment — done
- [[Algorithms - Ch1 Recursion|Algorithms Ch. 1]] — Erickson textbook read, notes written, Abdul Bari video watched

**Life**
- Lease signed Feb 25 after days of back-and-forth
- Move to Portland / West Linn in progress (Feb 26–27)
- Surgery date confirmed: March 12th
- MECOP pay rate confirmed: $27/hr — financial plan built in [[Financial Goals]]
- Retreat at Mount Angel monastery Feb 27–28

**Fitness**
- 5am workout on Feb 24
- Morning routine held both days

**LeetCode**
- First real attempt: Kth Largest Element — logic was correct, broke on duplicates

## Patterns Across the Days

### What's Working

**The morning block is strong.** Both days started with structure — 5am or 8am, prep session, earbuds in, focused work environment. This is the most reliable part of the routine right now and the thing most worth protecting.

**Academic work gets done in the morning.** CS381 HW, Algorithms Chapter 1, CS Ethics — all completed in morning sessions. The afternoon is noisier.

**Conceptual understanding over copying.** On the Haskell HW, the instinct was to understand the idea even when ChatGPT was helping. Same with the LeetCode attempt — built real logic, didn't just look up the answer. That's a pattern worth naming.

### What Needs Work

**Task lists are too long and mixed.** School tasks and life tasks compete on the same list, which dilutes priority. The 9-item Feb 24 list is the clearest example — "read Erickson" and "maybe look for a guitar" don't belong together.

**Afternoons get eaten.** Both days lost afternoon blocks — Feb 24 to the State of the Union + git plugin, Feb 25 to the lease situation. Front-loading matters. The pattern to build: if the morning block holds, the day is a success regardless of the afternoon.

**LeetCode problem selection.** Attempted Kth Largest (heap problem) while studying recursion. The mismatch made it harder than it needed to be. Fix: decide the LeetCode problem the night before, matched to the topic.

**Distraction-to-distraction pattern.** The git plugin rabbit hole on Feb 24 is a textbook ADHD novelty pull — something "urgent" appears right before the hard task starts. Pre-commit to the task before opening the laptop.

## Life Context

February has been heavy. Lease stress, cancer diagnosis, surgery scheduled for March 12th, move to Portland, helping parents remotely, a monastery retreat on the weekend. The amount of life admin this month is genuinely above normal — it's not an excuse, it's context.

The study days that happened (Feb 23–25) were good. The days that didn't (Feb 26–27) were legitimately not possible. That distinction matters for an honest read of the month.

MECOP is becoming concrete — $27/hr confirmed, financial plan built, goals set (Japan trip, Roth IRA, emergency fund). That clarity is something.

## Numbers to Track Going Forward

- Days with a morning study block: 3/5 tracked (2 off for move)
- Academic tasks completed: 4
- LeetCode problems attempted: 1
- LeetCode problems solved: 0 (close on first attempt)
- Life tasks completed: lease signed, move started, surgery date set, MECOP rate confirmed

---

## Focus for Rest of February

1. Keep the morning block — non-negotiable
2. 3 MITs per day, school and life separated
3. One matched LeetCode problem per algorithm topic
4. Pre-commit to the task before sitting down

---

## One Paragraph

A heavy month — move, surgery scheduled, lease drama, parents to coordinate, retreat. The study days that happened were genuinely good: algorithms Ch1 done, LeetCode attempted, HW submitted with understanding. The days that didn't happen were legitimately not possible. MECOP is now concrete with a real number ($27/hr) and a real financial plan. March will be its own thing — surgery on the 12th, recovery after, then back to building. The foundation is there.
