# February 2026 — Monthly Review

Part of [[2026]] — back to [[Reviews]]

*In progress — month not yet complete. Based on: [[2026-02-24 Review]], [[2026-02-25 Review]]*

---

## At a Glance

| | |
|--|--|
| Days tracked | 2 (Feb 24–25) |
| Streak | 3 days consecutive (started Feb 23) |
| Surgery date | March 12 — papillary thyroid cancer |
| Lease | Signed Feb 25 |

## What Got Done

**School**
- [[CS381 - Assignment 5|CS 381 HW 5]] — submitted, understood conceptually
- [[CS362 - Project|CS 362 project]] — set up
- CS Ethics assignment — done
- [[Algorithms - Ch1 Recursion|Algorithms Ch. 1]] — Erickson textbook read, notes written, Abdul Bari video watched

**Life**
- Lease signed after days of back-and-forth
- Grocery run
- Surgery date confirmed: March 12th

**Fitness**
- 5am workout on Feb 24
- Morning routine held both days

**LeetCode**
- First real attempt: Kth Largest Element — logic was correct, broke on duplicates

## Patterns Across the Days

### What's Working

**The morning block is strong.** Both days started with structure — 5am or 8am, prep session, earbuds in, focused work environment. This is the most reliable part of the routine right now and the thing most worth protecting.

**Academic work gets done in the morning.** CS381 HW, Algorithms Chapter 1, CS Ethics — all completed in morning sessions. The afternoon is noisier.

**Conceptual understanding over copying.** On the Haskell HW, the instinct was to understand the idea even when ChatGPT was helping. Same with the LeetCode attempt — built real logic, didn't just look up the answer. That's a pattern worth naming.

### What Needs Work

**Task lists are too long and mixed.** School tasks and life tasks compete on the same list, which dilutes priority. The 9-item Feb 24 list is the clearest example — "read Erickson" and "maybe look for a guitar" don't belong together.

**Afternoons get eaten.** Both days lost afternoon blocks — Feb 24 to the State of the Union + git plugin, Feb 25 to the lease situation. Front-loading matters. The pattern to build: if the morning block holds, the day is a success regardless of the afternoon.

**LeetCode problem selection.** Attempted Kth Largest (heap problem) while studying recursion. The mismatch made it harder than it needed to be. Fix: decide the LeetCode problem the night before, matched to the topic.

**Distraction-to-distraction pattern.** The git plugin rabbit hole on Feb 24 is a textbook ADHD novelty pull — something "urgent" appears right before the hard task starts. Pre-commit to the task before opening the laptop.

## Life Context

This month has been heavier than normal. The lease situation created low-grade background stress across multiple days. The surgery on March 12th is real weight to carry — even knowing the prognosis is good, it takes up mental space.

The consistency this week — showing up three days in a row with all of that in the background — is more meaningful than it looks on a checklist.

---

## Numbers to Track Going Forward

- Days with a morning study block: 2/2
- Academic tasks completed: 4
- LeetCode problems attempted: 1
- LeetCode problems solved: 0 (close on first attempt)

---

## Focus for Rest of February

1. Keep the morning block — non-negotiable
2. 3 MITs per day, school and life separated
3. One matched LeetCode problem per algorithm topic
4. Pre-commit to the task before sitting down

---

## One Paragraph

Two days tracked, both strong in the morning, both lost to life stuff in the afternoon. Lease is signed, surgery is scheduled, and the academic work that mattered got done. The ADHD patterns are consistent and named — novelty pulls, mixed task lists, discouragement on day two — which means they're workable. The month isn't over, but the foundation looks solid.
