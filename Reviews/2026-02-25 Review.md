# Day Review — 2026-02-25

Linked to: [[2026-02-25]]

## What Actually Happened

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 8:00 AM | Started — 15-min prep session |
| Morning | CS Ethics assignment (AI-assisted) |
| Morning | Algorithms Chapter 1 — Erickson textbook |
| Morning | Abdul Bari recursion video |
| During | Attempted Top K Element on LeetCode |
| Later | Day cut short — moving + lease situation |

---

## What You Completed

- ✅ CS Ethics assignment — done, AI-assisted, out of the way
- ✅ [[Algorithms - Ch1 Recursion|Algorithms Ch. 1]] — reductions, Tower of Hanoi, merge sort, got notes down
- ✅ Abdul Bari video — watched the recursion walkthrough
- ✅ 3rd consecutive day of the streak

---

## What Didn't Happen

- ❌ Merge sort LeetCode problem — started Top K Element instead, hit a wall
- ❌ Japanese study
- ❌ Side business planning
- ❌ Full day — cut short by moving and lease

## Honest Assessment

### The Good

You started at 8am and got real work done before life took over. The CS Ethics assignment is gone. You read Erickson, took notes, watched the video, and actually tried a LeetCode problem — that's the full study loop from your plan, attempted in one day. The fact that you hit the LeetCode problem and found it confusing isn't failure, that's just where the work gets hard. You showed up.

Three days in a row. That's the streak. Lease chaos is a legitimate reason a day gets cut short — that's not a discipline failure, that's just life happening.

### The Honest Part

"Top K Element" is not a recursion problem — it's a heap/priority queue problem. If you're on Chapter 1 of Erickson (recursion), a merge sort LeetCode would have been a cleaner match and probably less confusing. The mismatch between what you studied and what you tried to solve likely made it harder than it needed to be.

The "this is really confusi—" cut off in your notes is worth noticing. You hit friction and the day ended. That's fine for today. But that's the exact moment to name: *this is supposed to be confusing, this is where the learning is.* Next session, go back to it with the recursion framing — or swap to merge sort first as originally planned.

### The Streak Anxiety

You wrote yesterday that the anxiety around the streak is growing. Three days in, moving apartments, lease stress — and you still put in a morning. That's the streak doing what it's supposed to do. Don't let the fear of breaking it become its own distraction.

## Concrete Adjustments

### 1. Match the LeetCode problem to the topic

When you're on recursion, do a recursion problem. Merge sort ([LeetCode 912](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/) — sort an array) directly uses what you studied today. Top K Element requires a heap you haven't hit yet. Pick the problem *before* you sit down, same as picking the task.

### 2. Moving is a real constraint — plan around it

If the lease/moving situation is going to keep cutting days short, front-load your most important work to the morning block. You already do this instinctively. Keep doing it. Don't put LeetCode last if life keeps eating the afternoon.

### 3. When you hit a wall on LeetCode

Don't just stop. Write one sentence: "I got stuck because ____." Even if the answer is "I don't know" — write it. Then come back next session with that sentence as the starting point. It makes re-entry 10x easier.

## ADHD Notes

- Moving = massive executive function load. Lease negotiations, logistics, decisions — that's a lot of context-switching before your brain even gets to study mode. Be realistic about what a "short day" means right now.
- The earbuds-in focus routine is solid. Keep it.
- The dopamine ramp strategy (start slow, build through the day) is a smart approach — just make sure the morning block doesn't depend on the ramp completing. Do the hard stuff early while it's still structured.

## One Line Summary

Day cut short by real life, but the morning held — three days in a row, Chapter 1 done, just match the LeetCode to the topic next time.
