# Day Review — 2026-02-25

Linked to: [[2026-02-25]]

## What Actually Happened

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 8:00 AM | Started — 15-min prep session |
| Morning | CS Ethics assignment (AI-assisted) |
| Morning | Algorithms Chapter 1 — Erickson textbook + Abdul Bari video |
| Afternoon | Attempted Kth Largest Element on LeetCode — almost had it |
| Later | Lease signed |
| Evening | Chipotle + sushi with GF |

---

## What You Completed

- ✅ CS Ethics assignment — done and out of the way
- ✅ [[Algorithms - Ch1 Recursion|Algorithms Ch. 1]] — reductions, Tower of Hanoi, merge sort, notes written
- ✅ Abdul Bari recursion video
- ✅ Wrote a real LeetCode attempt — closer than you thought (see below)
- ✅ **Lease signed** — that's done
- ✅ 3rd consecutive day of the streak

---

## What Didn't Happen

- ❌ Merge sort LeetCode (did Kth Largest instead — wrong problem for the topic, but more effort than nothing)
- ❌ Japanese study
- ❌ Side business planning
- ❌ Calorie tracking — Chipotle and sushi, untracked

---

## Honest Assessment

### The Context

You're dealing with a lot right now. The lease has been hanging over you for days, and you've got surgery on March 12th — that's real weight to carry while trying to stay consistent. The fact that you kept showing up this week matters more than the checklist.

Papillary thyroid cancer has one of the best prognoses of any cancer — you probably already know that — but knowing it and feeling it are different things. The anxiety you've been writing about in these notes makes a lot more sense with that context. Give yourself some room.

### The Good

You actually sat down and tried to code a solution. That's not nothing — a lot of people freeze up on LeetCode and close the tab. You built a real attempt with real logic behind it. See the code breakdown below.

Three days. Lease signed. Morning routine held through all of it.

### The Code — You Were Close

You wrote this for Kth Largest Element (LeetCode 215):

```python
for i, num in enumerate(nums * k):
    if num > largest and num not in target:
        largest = num
    if (i + 1) % len(nums) == 0:
        target.append(largest)
        largest = float('-inf')
return target[-1]
```

**What you got right:** The core idea is correct — make k passes through the array, each time finding the largest value you haven't already found. That's actually selection sort logic applied to top-k. Clean thinking.

**The bug:** `return target[-1` is missing the closing `]` — just a typo.

**The real issue:** It breaks on duplicate values. If `nums = [5,5,4]` and `k=2`, your code skips the second 5 (since `5 in target` is True after pass 1), and returns 4 instead of 5. The problem treats duplicates as separate elements, but your `not in target` check collapses them.

**What the optimal solution looks like:** A min-heap of size k. Push everything in, maintain only the k largest. The top of the heap at the end is your answer — O(n log k) time. You'll get there when you hit the heaps chapter.

For now, the cleaner brute-force fix is sorting: `return sorted(nums)[-k]`. One line. Not optimal, but correct and gets you the concept.

### The Calorie Thing

One untracked dinner after a day like this is fine. You'd just signed a lease and closed a major stressor — sushi with your girlfriend is a reasonable ending. Don't let it become a two-day spiral.

## Concrete Adjustments

### 1. Match the LeetCode problem to the topic

Kth Largest is a heap problem. You're on recursion. Next session: merge sort LeetCode first, then come back to Kth Largest once you've hit heaps. Pick the problem before you sit down.

### 2. When the code almost works, note why it doesn't

You got stuck and stopped. Next time, write one line: *"This breaks on duplicates because ____."* That sentence is the starting point for next session and forces you to actually identify the failure, not just feel stuck.

### 3. March 12th

You've got two and a half weeks. Keep the mornings. If the surgery or the lead-up to it makes some days shorter, front-load the hard work and be realistic about the afternoon. The streak matters, but your health matters more — and being consistent *around* the surgery is more impressive than white-knuckling a number.

## ADHD Notes

- Signing the lease probably released a lot of background cognitive load you didn't realize was there. You might actually find the next few days feel clearer.
- The dopamine ramp routine (earbuds → slow build → end-of-day wind down) is good structure. Keep it.
- Surgery date is now a fixed point on the calendar — that can actually help with planning. You have a clear before/after.

## One Line Summary

Big day under the surface — lease done, surgery date set, real LeetCode attempt written, morning streak held. The code was close; the logic was right, just breaks on duplicates.
