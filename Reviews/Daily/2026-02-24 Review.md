Linked to: [[2026-02-24]]

## What Actually Happened

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:00 AM | Woke up |
| Morning | Workout |
| Morning | Starbucks — CS 381 HW 5 |
| ~10:00 AM | Leasing office |
| After | Grocery store |
| Afternoon | State of the Union (unplanned) |
| Late afternoon | Started algorithms catch-up |
| Evening | Japanese + wind down |

---

## What You Completed

- ✅ [[CS381 - Assignment 5|CS 381 HW 5]] — understood it conceptually, didn't just copy-paste (that's a real win)
- ✅ [[CS362 - Project|CS 362 project]] setup
- ✅ Leasing office errand
- ✅ Grocery run
- ✅ Got algorithms study started

---

## What Didn't Happen

- ❌ Chapter one of Erickson's textbook — see [[Algorithms Catch-Up]]
- ❌ WebSocket server in C
- ❌ Japanese study (planned but unsure if it happened)

## Honest Assessment

### The Good

You woke up at 5am, got a workout in, and put yourself in a productive environment early. That routine is one of the strongest things you can build — protect it at all costs. You also did something important on the CS 381 HW: you didn't just take the answer, you made sure you actually understood it. That's the right instinct.

### The Pattern to Watch

You sat down to read chapter one and ended up spending time fixing the git plugin. Then later you got pulled into watching the State of the Union. These aren't random failures — this is a very consistent pattern where an interesting or urgent-feeling stimulus pulls you off the planned task before you've built any momentum on it.

This is one of the clearest signs of an ADHD attention system: the brain isn't lazy, it's just highly reactive to novelty and interest. The git plugin "needed" to be fixed. The SOUA was genuinely interesting. Neither was the task.

### The Discouragement Loop

You wrote: *"I always hype myself but once again I feel like I just want to quit."* This is worth paying attention to. It shows up day two. That's not a character flaw — that's the ADHD boom/bust cycle. Day one feels like you cracked the code. Day two the friction returns and it feels like you're back to zero. You're not. The 5am wake-up happened two days in a row. That's a streak.

## Concrete Adjustments

### 1. Cut the list in half

You had 9 items on your todo list, ranging from "read a textbook chapter" to "maybe look for a guitar." Your brain cannot treat those with equal weight. Pick 3 MIT (Most Important Tasks) each morning — the ones that would make the day a success even if nothing else happened. Everything else is bonus.

**For a day like 2/24, your 3 MITs should have been:**
1. CS 381 HW 5
2. Read Erickson ch. 1
3. CS 362 project setup

That's it. The lease, groceries, guitar — those go on a separate "life tasks" list that you touch only after the MITs are done.

### 2. Protect the first block

The Starbucks session in the morning is your best window. When you sit down, the task should already be decided — you open Erickson, not your git settings. The decision of "what am I doing right now" should be made the night before or first thing before you leave the house. Arriving at Starbucks without a clear single task is how the git plugin wins.

### 3. Name the distractions before they happen

ADHD brains respond well to pre-commitment. Before you sit down, say out loud or write: "I am reading chapter one of Erickson. If something else comes up I am writing it down and coming back to it." This sounds too simple to work. It works.

### 4. Separate school from life on the list

Mix school tasks and personal errands on the same list and they'll compete for the same attention slot. Keep two lists:
- **Today (school):** 3 academic tasks
- **Life:** Lease, groceries, guitar, etc.

### 5. The "good enough" bar for CS homework

You flagged that ChatGPT carried you through Haskell — but then immediately noted you understood it conceptually. That's the right bar. You're not trying to be a Haskell expert, you're trying to understand the idea. Keep holding that line.

## ADHD Notes

A few things that tend to help for people with ADHD executive function patterns:

- **Body doubling** — Starbucks is already working for you. Use it more intentionally.
- **Implementation intentions** — "When I sit down at Starbucks, I will open Erickson to page 1" beats "I'll study algorithms."
- **Time anchors** — You know the clock hitting 10 was when you left for the office. Build more of these: "At 1pm I switch to algorithms no matter what."
- **Same seat, same task** — Environment encodes behavior. If you always do hard reading at the same spot, your brain starts to associate the spot with that mode.
- **Don't punish the distraction, redirect** — When you catch yourself on the git plugin, just write "fix git plugin" on the life list and close the settings. No shame spiral, just redirect.

## One Line Summary

You had a solid day with a real win on the HW — the main thing to fix is arriving at your work sessions with one clear task already decided, not figuring it out after you sit down.
