Linked to: [[2026-02-27]]

## What Actually Happened

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| All day | Moving to Portland — furniture store logistics (~4 hrs) |
| Evening | Driving to Mount Angel monastery for Holy Spirit retreat |

---

## What You Completed

- ✅ Got through two brutal logistical days
- ✅ Showed up for your parents (4 hours coordinating on the phone from Texas is a lot)
- ✅ Made it to Mount Angel

---

## What Didn't Happen

- ❌ Study session — this was never on the table today
- ❌ Streak technically — but context matters (see below)

---

## Honest Assessment

### Context First

You're moving cities, you have surgery in two weeks, you helped your parents navigate a furniture purchase remotely for four hours, and you're heading into a monastery weekend. There is no version of "you should have studied today." This is just life, and it's a heavy week.

The streak question: if you're tracking a daily consistency habit, days like this are the test of how you define it. Rigid tracking says the streak broke. Honest tracking says you've had three legitimate no-study days because you were managing a move, surgery prep, and a commitment to a retreat — not because you were avoiding work. Those are different things.

### The Retreat

A weekend at a monastery, disconnected from the noise, is probably exactly what you need right now. You've been running at full tilt — MECOP research, algorithms, lease, surgery scheduled, moving, parents, girlfriend. A forced slowdown is a feature, not a bug.

Come back Monday reset. The algorithms will still be there.

## No Adjustments Needed

This isn't a day to optimize. Rest. Be present at Mount Angel. Let the week decompress.

---

## One Line Summary

Heavy logistical day mid-move — you showed up for everything that needed showing up for, which is all that was possible today.
