## What Happened This Week

| Day | Key Events |
|-----|-----------|
| Mon Feb 23 | Streak started |
| Tue Feb 24 | CS381 HW5 done, algorithms started, git plugin + State of Union distracted afternoon |
| Wed Feb 25 | CS Ethics done, Algorithms Ch1 done, lease signed, surgery confirmed Mar 12, LeetCode attempt, sushi with GF |
| Thu Feb 26 | Moving — untracked |
| Fri Feb 27 | Furniture store 4hrs (helping parents by phone), driving to Mount Angel monastery retreat |
| Sat–Sun | Mount Angel retreat |

---

## What Got Done

- ✅ CS381 HW5 — submitted with conceptual understanding
- ✅ CS Ethics assignment — done
- ✅ [[Algorithms - Ch1 Recursion|Algorithms Ch1]] — full read, notes written, Abdul Bari video, LeetCode attempt
- ✅ CS362 project setup
- ✅ Lease signed after days of back-and-forth
- ✅ MECOP rate confirmed: $27/hr — financial plan built
- ✅ Surgery date confirmed: March 12
- ✅ Move to West Linn initiated

---

## What Didn't Happen

- ❌ Merge sort LeetCode (attempted wrong problem — Kth Largest is heap, not recursion)
- ❌ Japanese study
- ❌ Side business planning
- ❌ Full afternoons — both study days lost afternoons to life

## Patterns This Week

**The morning block is the only reliable window.** Both productive days held because of the morning session. The moment life interrupts in the afternoon, the day is effectively over for school work. This isn't a failure — it's the reality of this week. The system to build: if the morning block holds, the day counts.

**Life load was genuinely high.** Lease, move, surgery news, parents, retreat — this is a week where showing up at all is the win. Three study days out of five, with all that context, is solid.

**ADHD novelty pull pattern confirmed again.** Git plugin on Tuesday, State of the Union on Tuesday afternoon — both classic interest hijacks right before a hard task. Pre-committing to a single task before opening the laptop is still the main thing to fix.

**LeetCode topic mismatch.** Tried Kth Largest (heap) while on Ch1 recursion. Core logic was right but broke on duplicates. Next week: merge sort problem first, matched to the topic.

## Carry Into Next Week

- Do the merge sort LeetCode problem (it's already on the task list)
- Surgery is March 12 — two weeks out. Any prep needed (professor emails, accommodations)?
- Return from Mount Angel reset — use the clarity from the retreat
- First full week in the new place — establish the morning routine in the new environment

## One Paragraph

Heavy week — move, surgery confirmed, lease drama, parents, monastery retreat. The study days that happened were good and complete. The days that didn't were genuinely not possible. Week 9 is mostly a logistics week with some real academic wins inside it. Week 10 is the first full week in the new place — that's where the routine either locks in or doesn't.

## Vision Lens — Week 9

This week, measured against the man being built:

| Pillar | Week 9 | Verdict |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Craft / Engineering** | HW5 done with understanding, CS Ethics done, Algorithms Ch1 complete, real LeetCode attempt | Strong. The instinct to understand rather than copy is consistent |
| **Physical** | 5am workout Feb 24, morning routine held on study days | Present but inconsistent — move week is the excuse, not the pattern |
| **Faith** | Holy Spirit retreat at Mount Angel monastery Feb 27–28 | One of the best things you did this week. Deliberate investment in the right direction |
| **Japanese** | Zero reps all week | The gap that will compound if March starts the same way |
| **Wealth / MECOP** | $27/hr confirmed, financial plan built | Foundational. The Japan fund has a real number now |
| **Family / Loyalty** | 4 hours helping parents mid-move, GF dinner after lease stress | The behavior is already there. The future father showed up this week |

**The honest read on Week 9:** A lot of life happened and you stayed standing. The faith investment (retreat) and the loyalty investment (parents) are the underrated wins — they don't show on an academic tracker but they're exactly the behavior the Life Vision is built on.

**The gap that matters most heading into Week 10:** Japanese. Zero reps this entire week. If Japan is real, Anki is non-negotiable — not because one week matters, but because the habit either exists or it doesn't. Monday morning, before anything else.
