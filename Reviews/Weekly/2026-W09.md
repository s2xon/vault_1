## What Got Done

- ✅ CS381 HW5 — submitted with conceptual understanding
- ✅ CS Ethics assignment — done
- ✅ [[Algorithms - Ch1 Recursion|Algorithms Ch1]] — full read, notes written, Abdul Bari video, LeetCode attempt
- ✅ CS362 project setup
- ✅ Lease signed after days of back-and-forth
- ✅ MECOP rate confirmed: $27/hr — financial plan built
- ✅ Surgery date confirmed: March 12
- ✅ Move to West Linn initiated

---

## What Didn't Happen

- ❌ Merge sort LeetCode (attempted wrong problem — Kth Largest is heap, not recursion)
- ❌ Japanese study
- ❌ Side business planning
- ❌ Full afternoons — both study days lost afternoons to life

## Patterns This Week

**The morning block is the only reliable window.** Both productive days held because of the morning session. The moment life interrupts in the afternoon, the day is effectively over for school work. This isn't a failure — it's the reality of this week. The system to build: if the morning block holds, the day counts.

**Life load was genuinely high.** Lease, move, surgery news, parents, retreat — this is a week where showing up at all is the win. Three study days out of five, with all that context, is solid.

**ADHD novelty pull pattern confirmed again.** Git plugin on Tuesday, State of the Union on Tuesday afternoon — both classic interest hijacks right before a hard task. Pre-committing to a single task before opening the laptop is still the main thing to fix.

**LeetCode topic mismatch.** Tried Kth Largest (heap) while on Ch1 recursion. Core logic was right but broke on duplicates. Next week: merge sort problem first, matched to the topic.

## Carry Into Next Week

- Do the merge sort LeetCode problem (it's already on the task list)
- Surgery is March 12 — two weeks out. Any prep needed (professor emails, accommodations)?
- Return from Mount Angel reset — use the clarity from the retreat
- First full week in the new place — establish the morning routine in the new environment

## One Paragraph

Heavy week — move, surgery confirmed, lease drama, parents, monastery retreat. The study days that happened were good and complete. The days that didn't were genuinely not possible. Week 9 is mostly a logistics week with some real academic wins inside it. Week 10 is the first full week in the new place — that's where the routine either locks in or doesn't.
