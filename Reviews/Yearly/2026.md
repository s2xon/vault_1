## Year Themes

*Built up over time as monthly reviews accumulate.*

### So Far (Feb)

The year started with a push toward consistency — daily streak, morning routines, structured study. The context is heavy: four active CS courses, a catch-up plan for algorithms, a surgery in March, and a move happening simultaneously. The foundation being built now will matter for the rest of the year.
