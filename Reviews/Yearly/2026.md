## The Man Being Built — 2026 Arc

This is the year the foundation gets laid. Not the year the vision is complete — the year the behaviors that make it possible become automatic.

**What 2026 is actually building:**
- The engineer who knows his fundamentals (algorithms catch-up, passing four CS courses, MECOP reps)
- The body that can be trained daily (jujitsu, lifting, morning routine)
- The faith that holds under pressure (daily prayer, sacraments, retreat discipline)
- The financial base that makes everything else possible (MECOP savings, Japan fund, Roth IRA started)
- The Japanese habit that compounds over years (Anki daily — that's it, just Anki daily)

The surgery in March is part of the year. Not a detour — part of it. How you come back from that is a data point about the man being built.

## Yearly Goals

*These are measured against the [[Life Vision]], not just a task list.*

### Craft / Engineering
- [ ] Pass all 4 active CS courses (CS361, CS362, CS340, CS381)
- [ ] Get algorithms solid — Erickson cover to cover + matched LeetCode — see [[Algorithms Catch-Up]]
- [ ] MECOP work term — show up prepared, perform well, build professional reps
- [ ] Ship something real for Conn app — see [[Conn - Overview]]

### Physical
- [ ] Hold morning routine across the full year — not perfectly, consistently
- [ ] Jujitsu — keep going. Don't let it slip when the calendar gets hard
- [ ] Lifting — progressive, logged, not missed more than two weeks in a row

### Faith
- [ ] Daily prayer — morning, even 5 minutes, even tired
- [ ] Sacraments — confession regularly, Mass weekly
- [ ] At least one retreat (Mount Angel Feb 27–28 already counts — more if possible)

### Japanese
- [ ] Anki every day — this is the single most important language habit
- [ ] Weekly lessons — grammar mining into the vault
- [ ] End of year: able to hold a basic conversation and read hiragana/katakana fluently

### Wealth / Japan
- [ ] Save $7,000 for Japan trip — see [[Financial Goals]]
- [ ] Open Roth IRA during MECOP term and hit first contribution
- [ ] Emergency fund started — even $500 is the start
- [ ] Japan trip — timing after MECOP term. Make it happen, not just a goal

### Surgery + Health
- [ ] March 12th surgery — prepare professors, handle logistics, recover properly
- [ ] Come back to routine within two weeks of recovery cleared

## Year Themes — Built as Months Accumulate

### Through February

Heavy start. A lot of life admin compressed into a few weeks — move, surgery diagnosis, lease, parents, MECOP confirmation. The study days that happened were good and real. The foundation of the morning routine held under genuine pressure.

The faith investment at Mount Angel (Feb 27–28) was the most important thing done in February that doesn't show on an academic tracker.

The gap: Japanese. Zero tracked reps across all of February. If this is still true in March, it's a pattern. If it's still true in June, Japan is a fantasy, not a goal.

## December Check-In Questions

*(Answer these at year end)*

1. Does the morning routine feel automatic now, or is it still a fight?
2. Where is the Japanese? Can you hold a conversation?
3. What did MECOP teach you about how you actually work?
4. Did you come back from surgery stronger or did it become an excuse?
5. Is the Japan fund real — or just a number on a page?
6. What does your relationship with God look like compared to January?
7. Are you the man in the [[Life Vision]] — closer, further, or the same?
