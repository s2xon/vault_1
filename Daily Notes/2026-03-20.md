## Journal

*(What happened today — wins, what was hard, distractions, how you felt, anything on your mind. Claude reads this to write your review. Even 3 sentences is enough to work with.)*

*(Example: "Got through the CS381 stuff in the morning — took longer than expected because I kept second-guessing the Haskell syntax. LeetCode attempt was decent, got the base case right but fumbled the recursive step. Afternoon got away from me after [X]. Tomorrow I need to [Y].")*
