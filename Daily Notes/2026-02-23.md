## Log

- **5am** — Woke up, hit the gym. Did most of my lifts but skipped a few sets to get moving faster.
- **Morning** — Coffee shop. Used AI to get through all the school assignments that were due today.
- **~10am** — Went to the leasing office. The office made another mistake — need to get re-approval from corporate before they can process the lease.
- **Afternoon** — Home, made decaf. Got on a Discord call with friends while trying to do homework (didn't help focus).
- **~5pm** — Nearly finished Anki, wrapping up the day.

### Topics to Prioritize

See [[CS Catch-Up Roadmap]] for the full plan.

- Operating Systems

> Focus: once school stuff is done, start building out tasks for algorithms and networks.

## Notes

- The leasing situation is getting frustrating — need to follow up with corporate directly
- Procrastination + ChatGPT is a pattern to break — it's catching up, not learning
