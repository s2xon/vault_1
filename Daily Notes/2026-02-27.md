## Main Tasks

- [ ] Survive the move and Mount Angel weekend
- [ ] Rest — this is a recovery day, not a study day

---

## Notes

Two rough days. Moving to Portland — spent ~4 hours at a furniture store helping parents on the phone from Texas coordinate with the sales rep. Logistics and decision fatigue on top of everything else.

Now heading to Mount Angel in Oregon for a Holy Spirit weekend retreat at a monastery. Stressed going in.
