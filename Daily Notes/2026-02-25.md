## Notes

I started at 8am and do a 15 min prep session after this i put in earbuds to help me focus more and to slowly raise the dopamine throughout the day then try to meditate hard read and relax hard at the end of the day to get back to base line


3rd consecutive day of the streak. Feeling some anxiety around it — fear of breaking it and having to start over. Working on being okay with failure instead of avoiding risk.

Used 15-min prep time to submit HW5 for [[CS381 - Notes|CS 381]]. Got to school at 10.
