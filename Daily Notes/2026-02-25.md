## Notes

Started at 8am. 15-min prep session first, then earbuds in to build focus and slowly raise dopamine throughout the day. End of day: meditate, hard read, relax to get back to baseline.

3rd consecutive day of the streak. Feeling some anxiety around it — fear of breaking it and having to start over. Working on being okay with failure instead of avoiding risk.

Used prep time to submit HW5 for [[CS381 - Notes|CS 381]]. Got to school at 10.
