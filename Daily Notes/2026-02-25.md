## Notes

Started at 8am. 15-min prep session first, then earbuds in to build focus and slowly raise dopamine throughout the day. End of day: meditate, hard read, relax to get back to baseline.

3rd consecutive day of the streak. Feeling some anxiety around it — fear of breaking it and having to start over. Working on being okay with failure instead of avoiding risk.

Used prep time to submit HW5 for [[CS381 - Notes|CS 381]]. Got to school at 10.

I am going ahead and going to review the day everything kinda went away but i finnally got this lease signed i have palpilary thyroid cancer surgery mach 12th so this is all a relief

i did actually almost come up with a solution

```python
class Solution:

def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

target = []

largest = float('-inf')

for i, num in enumerate(nums * k):

if num > largest and num not in target:

largest = num

if (i + 1) % len(nums) == 0:

target.append(largest)

largest = float('-inf')

return target[-1
```

after this ecaustive day i went to chiptole instead of tracking my calories like i have been then had sushi with my gf
