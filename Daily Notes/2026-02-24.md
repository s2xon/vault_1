## Notes

Yesterday was great.
Today was defintly harder than yesterday i am a little discoraged i always hype myself but once again i feel like I just want to quit and not do what i need to do to get things done

I started at the chapter one however i got side tracked by my git plugin and making it work with my ipad

today i woke up at 5 like yesterday did a decenmt workoiut then went to starbucks i then studied and did the cs 381 hw and i barley understood how to code in haskell so vhatgpt carried me however better than usual i didnt just copy and paste the solution at leaset coceptually i understood what i was doing

then the clok hit 10 so  i went to the leasing office to figure out the lease situation and they still had no updates then i went to thne store got smoothis stuff at my 225 chicken breast and then got distracted a little waching trumps state of the union address whivh was silly and interesting uin todays politival vlimate then i started studing for algorithms and now i am going to do japanese study and chill till 5p
