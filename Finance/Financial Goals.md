## The Priority Stack

When money comes in (MECOP pay, side income, anything), this is the order to deploy it:

1. **Cover necessities** — rent, food, utilities, phone
2. **Emergency fund** — 3 months of expenses, sitting in a HYSA, don't touch it
3. **Pay down any high-interest debt** — anything above ~6% interest rate
4. **Roth IRA** — up to $7,000/year (2026 limit), only while you have earned income from work
5. **Save for goals** — graduation buffer, move fund, whatever's next
6. **Everything else** — discretionary, fun, side projects

## Emergency Fund

**Target:** 3 months of living expenses

Estimate your monthly expenses (Corvallis/Portland range):
| Category | Monthly Estimate |
|----------|-----------------|
| Rent | $800–1,200 |
| Food | $300–500 |
| Transport | $100–200 |
| Phone | $50–80 |
| Subscriptions/misc | $50–100 |
| **Total** | **~$1,300–2,100/mo** |

**Target emergency fund: ~$4,000–6,000**

Keep this in a **High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)** — not a regular savings account. Current HYSA rates are 4–5% APY. Options: Marcus (Goldman Sachs), Ally, SoFi, Discover. Takes 10 minutes to open, takes nothing to maintain.

- [ ] Open a HYSA
- [ ] Deposit enough to hit 1 month of expenses before first MECOP term
- [ ] Hit 3 months by end of first work term

## Roth IRA

A Roth IRA is the single best financial move for a person your age with earned income.

**Why:** You contribute *after-tax* dollars now (low tax rate as a student/intern), and everything grows tax-free forever. At retirement, you pay zero taxes on withdrawals — including all the gains.

**The math:** $7,000 invested at 22 years old, growing at 7%/year average for 40 years = ~$104,000. Tax free.

**Rules:**
- Contribution limit: $7,000/year (2026)
- Must have earned income equal to or greater than your contribution
- Income limit: you can contribute the full amount if your income is under ~$150,000 (not a concern yet)
- You can withdraw *contributions* (not gains) at any time penalty-free — so it can double as an emergency backup

**Where to open one:** Fidelity or Vanguard. Both are free. Fidelity has a slightly better UI. Invest in a target-date index fund (e.g., Fidelity Freedom 2060) or a total market index fund (FSKAX or VTI).

- [ ] Open Roth IRA at Fidelity or Vanguard
- [ ] Contribute during first MECOP term (you'll have the earned income to qualify)
- [ ] Contribute as close to $7,000/year as possible during work terms

## MECOP Term Targets

*Update once offer and pay rate are confirmed. These are estimates based on $28–32/hr.*

| | Conservative ($28/hr) | Target ($32/hr) |
|--|----------------------|-----------------|
| Gross per term | $29,000 | $33,000 |
| Take-home (est.) | $22,700 | $25,700 |
| Living expenses | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| Emergency fund top-up | $2,000 | $2,000 |
| Roth IRA contribution | $7,000 | $7,000 |
| **Free savings** | **~$3,700** | **~$6,700** |

## Longer Term Goals

- [ ] Graduate with emergency fund fully funded (3 months)
- [ ] Graduate with Roth IRA contributions in for every work term
- [ ] No high-interest debt at graduation
- [ ] Have a clear plan for first full-time salary *before* first paycheck arrives

### First Full-Time Salary Plan (Draft)

CS graduates in the Pacific NW typically start at $95,000–$130,000 base. When that hits:
- Max 401k match immediately (free money, always take it)
- Max Roth IRA ($7,000/year)
- Build emergency fund to 6 months if not already there
- Everything above necessities + savings → goals (pay off anything, invest more, business)

## Side Business

You mentioned figuring out your side business — that income is also Roth IRA-eligible if it's self-employment income (freelance, contracting, etc.). Keep that in mind once it starts generating revenue.

Track business income separately from personal income. Even a simple spreadsheet. You'll need it for taxes (self-employment tax is a real thing — budget ~15% of net profit for it).

- [ ] Decide on the side business direction — see [[Ideas]]
- [ ] Open a separate bank account for business income when it starts
- [ ] Track income and expenses from day one
