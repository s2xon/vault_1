## The Numbers (Based on $27/hr MECOP)

**Per term (6 months, 40hr/week, no overtime):**

| | Amount |
|--|--------|
| Gross pay | $28,080 |
| Federal income tax (est.) | ~$1,380 |
| Oregon state tax (est.) | ~$1,384 |
| FICA (Social Security + Medicare) | ~$2,148 |
| **Take-home per term** | **~$23,168** |
| **Monthly take-home** | **~$3,860** |

*Overtime at $40.50/hr adds significant upside — even 4hrs/week overtime adds ~$2,100/term.*

## Monthly Budget (West Linn, OR)

| Category | Monthly | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Rent | $1,000 | Confirmed |
| Utilities (gas/electric/water) | $50 | Quoted at $8 — flagging this as likely low, budgeting conservatively |
| WiFi | $60 | Confirmed |
| Japanese lessons | $120 | $30/week × 4 weeks |
| Jujitsu | $120 | Estimate — confirm when you sign up |
| Food (beyond SNAP) | $100 | SNAP covers ~$300/mo — this is eating out + misc |
| Gas / transport | $125 | West Linn is suburban, need a car |
| Phone | $65 | Estimate |
| Misc / buffer | $75 | Buffer for random stuff |
| **Total expenses** | **~$1,715** | |
| **Monthly leftover** | **~$2,145** | |
| **Term leftover (6 mo)** | **~$12,870** | |

## Savings Plan Per Term

With ~$12,870 available after expenses each term, here's how to deploy it:

| Goal | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Japan trip fund | $7,000 | Priority goal — fund this first term |
| Roth IRA | $3,500 | Half the annual limit — do more if possible |
| Emergency fund top-up | $1,000 | Keep building toward 3-month target |
| Loan payment buffer | $1,000 | Extra toward loans on top of minimum |
| **Total allocated** | **$12,500** | |

*After the Japan trip is funded (term 1), redirect that $7,000 slot in term 2 toward Roth IRA (max it at $7,000) + loans.*

## Goal Breakdown

### Japan Trip — $7,000

- Round-trip flight from Portland to Tokyo (JAL/ANA): ~$900–1,200
- Accommodations for 2–3 weeks: ~$1,500–2,500 (mix of hostels/Airbnb)
- Food, transport (JR Pass), activities: ~$2,000–3,000
- Buffer: $500–1,000

$7,000 is a solid budget for 2–3 weeks in Japan. Achievable in first MECOP term.

- [ ] Open a dedicated savings account or HYSA bucket labeled "Japan"
- [ ] Auto-transfer a fixed amount monthly during work term
- [ ] Book flights 3–4 months in advance for best price

---

### Emergency Fund — Target $4,500

3 months of expenses at ~$1,715/month = **$5,145**. Round to $5,000 target.

- [ ] Open a HYSA (Marcus, Ally, SoFi — all around 4–5% APY)
- [ ] Fund to $1,000 before term starts if possible
- [ ] Hit $5,000 by end of term 2

---

### Roth IRA — Max During Work Terms

You have earned income during MECOP terms. Use it.

- Contribution limit: $7,000/year (2026)
- Best accounts: Fidelity or Vanguard
- Best investment: FSKAX (Fidelity total market) or VTI (Vanguard total market)
- Why it matters: $7,000 invested at 22 grows to ~$104,000 by retirement at 7% average. Tax free.

- [ ] Open Roth IRA at Fidelity before first work term paycheck
- [ ] Set up auto-contribution during term
- [ ] Contribute $3,500 term 1, try to max ($7,000) term 2+

---

### Student Loans

Pay minimums during school. During work terms, add a small extra payment — even $100–200/month extra cuts years off the loan and saves significant interest.

- [ ] Log actual loan balance and interest rate here when you have it
- [ ] Calculate whether it makes more sense to pay extra vs invest (if loan rate < 6%, invest first)

---

### Jujitsu

Budget $120/month estimate. Confirm actual cost when you sign up. Good gyms in West Linn / Lake Oswego / Portland area. Worth every dollar — especially with surgery recovery in March, check with the surgeon about when contact sports are cleared.

---

## Priority Stack

When MECOP pay comes in each month:

1. Pay rent + utilities + necessities
2. Auto-transfer to Japan fund
3. Auto-transfer to Roth IRA (set it up to come out automatically)
4. Extra loan payment
5. Whatever's left = discretionary

Don't make saving a willpower thing — automate it so the money is gone before you can spend it.
