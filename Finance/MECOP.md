# MECOP — Multiple Engineering Cooperative Program

Part of [[Finance]] — see also [[Financial Goals]]

---

## What Is MECOP

MECOP is a competitive co-op program run through Oregon State University. Students alternate between full-time school terms and full-time 6-month paid work terms at engineering companies. Most CS students complete 2–3 work terms total.

It's not a summer internship — it's full-time employment for 6 months at a time. You're on a work term instead of a school term, so you're earning a real salary while making academic progress (MECOP credits count toward graduation).

**Why it matters financially:** A single MECOP term at CS-level pay can net $10,000–$15,000 in savings after expenses. Two terms can cover most of the cost of finishing school.

## Pay Reality Check

*Based on typical MECOP CS rates. Update when you have your actual offer.*

Typical CS student rate: **$25–35/hr**

At $28/hr, full time, 26 weeks:
- Gross: ~$29,000
- After taxes (~22% effective): ~$22,700 take-home
- Living expenses 6 months (Corvallis/Portland): ~$9,000–11,000
- **Net savings potential per term: $11,000–13,000**

At $32/hr (Intel-range):
- Gross: ~$33,000
- After taxes: ~$25,700 take-home
- **Net savings potential per term: $14,000–16,000**

Two terms = potentially $22,000–32,000 saved before graduation.

## Application Prep

### Technical Skills to Have Locked In

- [ ] Data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, trees, graphs
- [ ] Algorithms: sorting (merge, quick), BFS/DFS, binary search — see [[Algorithms Catch-Up]]
- [ ] Big-O analysis — be able to explain time and space complexity for anything you write
- [ ] OOP concepts: classes, inheritance, polymorphism — see [[Types and Polymorphism]]
- [ ] Systems basics: what a process is, what memory is, basic OS concepts
- [ ] Git: branching, merging, pull requests — know this cold
- [ ] One language you're strong in (Python, C++, Java)

### Soft Skills / Resume

- [ ] Resume polished — GPA, relevant coursework, projects, any prior work
- [ ] Projects: at least one thing you built that you can talk about technically
- [ ] Be able to explain Conn app (or any side project) end-to-end — what problem, what decisions, what you learned
- [ ] Practice behavioral questions: tell me about a time you debugged something, handled a hard deadline, etc.

### Interview Format (Varies by Company)

Most MECOP interviews are:
1. Resume screen / GPA check
2. Technical phone screen or coding challenge
3. Technical interview (LeetCode-style or whiteboard)
4. Team-fit conversation

Intel tends to be more systems-focused. HP and Tektronix lean more software engineering generalist.

## Goals for the Work Term

- [ ] Work on a real production codebase — not a tutorial project
- [ ] Understand how a real engineering team operates (code reviews, sprints, standups)
- [ ] Build one thing I can talk about in future interviews
- [ ] Network with at least 3 engineers I'd want to stay in touch with
- [ ] Figure out which domain I want after graduation (embedded, backend, systems, etc.)
- [ ] Hit savings target for the term (set once offer is in)

## Surgery Context — March 12th

Recovery from thyroid surgery is typically 1–2 weeks before returning to normal activity. If a MECOP start date falls close to March, flag this during the application process — companies are generally understanding about medical situations when communicated early. Keep this in mind for timeline planning.
