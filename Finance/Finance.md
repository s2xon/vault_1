## The Short Version

Right now the only job is get MECOP locked in. That's the financial lever that changes everything — one work term can fund the emergency fund, open the Roth IRA, and cover most of living expenses for 6 months.

Order of operations:
1. **Get the MECOP offer** → [[MECOP]]
2. **Open a HYSA** → emergency fund target $4,000–6,000
3. **Open a Roth IRA** → contribute during every work term
4. **Figure out the side business** → [[Ideas]]

Nothing else needs to happen before step 1. Stay focused there.
