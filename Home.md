## How to Use This Vault

1. **Need to write something fast?** Drop a new note in the vault root — Claude will sort it.
2. **In class?** Go straight to the course page, write under the current week.
3. **Logging a workout?** Copy the template in [[Lifting Tracker]].
4. **Have an idea?** Drop it in root or go straight to [[Ideas]].
5. **Want Claude to organize?** Point Claude to `.claude-context.md`.

**Shortcuts:** `Cmd+O` open anything | `Cmd+N` new note | `[[` to link | `Cmd+G` graph view
