# Claude Context

Last updated: 2026-02-24 (cleanup + daily review system added)

---

## Workflow

User drops notes in the vault root (messy is fine). Claude sorts — cleans up phrasing, adds frontmatter (tags + aliases), adds backlinks, creates folders/tags if needed, then moves the note to the right place.

## All Notes Have Frontmatter

Every note has YAML frontmatter with:
- `aliases` - alternate names so Obsidian suggests them when typing `[[`
- `tags` - for graph view colors and filtering

When creating new notes, always add frontmatter.
