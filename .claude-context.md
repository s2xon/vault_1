# Claude Context

Last updated: 2026-02-27 (daily note + review added, monthly/yearly updated, Finance pages built out with real budget numbers, auto-behaviors added to CLAUDE.md, nav tag removed everywhere)

## Workflow

User drops notes in the vault root (messy is fine). Claude sorts — cleans up phrasing, adds frontmatter (tags + aliases), adds backlinks, creates folders/tags if needed, then moves the note to the right place.

## Tag System

Flat only — no subtags. Tags = central graph nodes. Navigation = backlinks.

| Tag | For |
|-----|-----|
| `#school` | Actual coursework — CS381, CS362, CS361, CS340, assignments, lecture notes |
| `#academic` | Self-directed learning — algorithms catch-up, chapter notes, deep dives, roadmaps |
| `#project` | Any project |
| `#finance` | Finance, MECOP, goals |
| `#fitness` | Workouts, health |
| `#idea` | Ideas |
| `#daily` | Daily notes |
| `#review` | Reviews |

---

## Graph View Groups

| Query | Color |
|-------|-------|
| `tag:#school` | Blue |
| `tag:#fitness` | Green |
| `tag:#project` | Purple |
| `tag:#idea` | Yellow |
| `tag:#inbox` | Red |
| `tag:#finance` | Orange |

## All Notes Have Frontmatter

Every note has YAML frontmatter with:
- `aliases` - alternate names so Obsidian suggests them when typing `[[`
- `tags` - for graph view colors and filtering

When creating new notes, always add frontmatter.

---

## What Claude Does Each Session

1. Read this file first
2. Check root for unsorted notes
3. Clean up phrasing and fix formatting
4. Add frontmatter if missing
5. Add backlinks between related notes
6. Create new folder or tag if nothing fits
7. Move note to the right place
8. Update this file with changes made
