# Claude Context

Last updated: 2026-02-15

## Workflow

User writes notes (messy is fine). Claude organizes — files into folders, adds frontmatter (tags + aliases), adds backlinks, keeps graph view clean.

Inbox folder is the main drop zone. User dumps anything there, Claude sorts it later.

## All Notes Have Frontmatter

Every note has YAML frontmatter with:
- `aliases` - alternate names so Obsidian suggests them when typing `[[`
- `tags` - for graph view colors and filtering

When creating new notes, always add frontmatter.
