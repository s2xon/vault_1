# Life Vision — The Clan of Payne

Back to [[Home]]

*This is the long game. Not a goal list — a picture of the man and the life being built. Read this when the morning is hard.*

---

## The Man

A Catholic man who takes his faith seriously. Not performance — actual relationship with God. Daily prayer, confession, sacraments, the whole thing. The kind of man who can sit in silence and not reach for his phone because he's genuinely at peace. Humble because he knows where his gifts came from. Disciplined because he loves the people depending on him.

The kind of engineer who builds real things that matter. Not chasing titles — chasing craft. Reads the hard books, does the hard problems, ships working software. Doesn't bluff his way through interviews. Knows his fundamentals cold because he did the work to actually learn them.

A soldier in the sense that matters — not military (though respect to it), but in the way he shows up. Early. Consistent. Unflinching when it's uncomfortable. Trains his body because a strong body is a form of gratitude and a tool for everything else.

## The Family

Married. Kids. The goal isn't just to have a family — it's to build a culture. The Clan of Payne has its own identity: what we eat, how we move, what we believe, what we build together.

**What that looks like:**
- Morning routine that belongs to everyone — prayer, movement, food
- No electronics as babysitters. Kids are bored sometimes. That's fine. Boredom builds something
- Martial arts together — jujitsu, discipline, how to fall and get back up
- Lifting when they're old enough. Health is a family value, not a personal preference
- Hiking, running, physical challenge as normal — not exceptional
- Tatami floor meditation, even if the kids last three minutes before they start wrestling. You laugh, you tell them five more minutes, you switch to a five-mile mountain run

The goal is a family that knows who they are. Kids who grow up with a strong father who was also present, who laughed, who trained them hard and loved them harder.

## Japan

Not a trip. A life chapter. Living in Japan — tatami mats, discipline of place, the culture of mastery and respect that runs through everything there. The aesthetic of it. The quietness of a country that takes craft seriously.

Japan isn't escapism — it's a deliberate choice of environment to become a specific kind of person. The plan is to be fluent, to earn the right to be there, to live inside the culture rather than just observe it.

**What makes this possible:**
- Engineering skills that travel (remote-first or international roles)
- Financial foundation built during MECOP terms
- Japanese — Anki every day, grammar mining, weekly lessons, eventual fluency
- $7k Japan fund is the first step, not the last

## Craft — The 100x Engineer

Not a myth — a standard. The engineer who:
- Knows algorithms, systems, databases, networks from first principles (hence the catch-up)
- Ships things that actually work
- Reads source code for fun
- Understands what the computer is actually doing, not just what the abstraction says it does
- Gets recruited, doesn't chase. Has options

The MECOP internship is the beginning of the professional arc — not just for money, but for reps. Every term is a chance to get better, build credibility, and understand what industry actually wants from engineers.

The CS degree is the foundation. Not the ceiling.

## Physical

The body is infrastructure. Strong, mobile, healthy — maintained not for aesthetics but because everything else depends on it.

- Jujitsu — already happening. Keep it going. The mat is where discipline is built in real-time
- Lifting — PPL, consistent, progressive. PR the big lifts
- Running — enough cardiovascular base to run five miles in the mountains and not die
- Diet — clean fuel. Not complicated. Just consistent

Eventually this gets taught to the kids. That's the long play.

## Wealth — The Enabler, Not the Point

Money is what makes the Japan chapter possible. What funds the family culture. What removes the survival anxiety that kills the ability to be present and build.

Not rich to be rich. Rich to be free — to choose where to live, how to work, what to build, and to give generously.

**The arc:**
- MECOP → $27/hr → savings stack ($12k+ per term potential)
- Senior engineer → principal → high-leverage role
- Japan fund, Roth IRA, emergency fund — in that priority order while young
- Eventually: enough that money is not the constraint on any decision that actually matters

## Near-Term Anchors

*The vision is far. These are the handles to grab right now.*

| Now | Horizon |
|-----|---------|
| MECOP $27/hr, savings discipline | Financial base for Japan and everything else |
| CS degree, strong fundamentals | Credibility + actual competence |
| Algorithms catch-up (Erickson → Abdul Bari → LeetCode) | Being the engineer who actually knows his stuff |
| Jujitsu, lifting, morning routine | Body and discipline as infrastructure |
| Japanese (Anki daily, lessons weekly) | First step toward the Japan chapter |
| Surgery recovery (March 12) | Get through it. Then build |
| Morning block protection | The one reliable window. Guard it. |

## The Review Lens

When reviewing a week, ask:
1. Did the morning block hold?
2. Did the body get trained?
3. Did Japanese get any reps?
4. Did the academic work move forward?
5. Was anything done from fear/avoidance vs. real priority?

A week doesn't have to be perfect. It has to trend toward the man described above.
