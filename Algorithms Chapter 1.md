# Recursion
1.1 Reductions
- Reduction is the most common twqunieq used in designing algorithms.
This topic is pretty easy for recursion basically just break the idea into smaller bits. A king has a math problem and passes two sides of the equation to his attendants and so on...

1.2 Simplify and Delegate
- If the given instance of the problem can br dolved direvtly, solve it directley.
- Otherwise, reduce it to one or more simiplier instace sof the same problem
- The induction hypothesis is also recursion
I hate the induction hypothesis. Also this chapter is super easy.

1.3 Tower of Hanoi
This one has a super confusing example buts its fine basically just ignore everything but the bottom disk to the last disk is always the base case and you use the temp needle as a way to recursivley get largest to smallest up to down

1.4 Merge Sort
- First we split array into 2
- Then we sort
- then we merge
This one is pretty easy (Do a merge sort leetcode problem)

O(n) basiaclly becuase we split twice. I kinfa forgot this part

1.5 Quick sort
Then it looks like mergesort is keep dividing the sub arrays till base case then build up sort merge recurse like that
