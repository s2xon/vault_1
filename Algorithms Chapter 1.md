# Recursion
1.1 Reductions
- Reduction is the most common twqunieq used in designing algorithms.
This topic is pretty easy for recursion basically just break the idea into smaller bits. A king has a math problem and passes two sides of the equation to his attendants and so on...

1.2 Simplify and Delegate
- If the given instance of the problem can br dolved direvtly, solve it directley.
- Otherwise, reduce it to one or more simiplier instace sof the same problem
- The induction hypothesis is also recursion
I hate the induction hypothesis. Also this chapter is super easy.
