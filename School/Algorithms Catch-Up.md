# Algorithms Catch-Up

Part of [[School]]

## Study Loop

For each topic:
1. Read the theory (Jeff Erickson's *Algorithms* — free at [jeffe.cs.illinois.edu](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/))
2. Watch Abdul Bari on YouTube for visual walkthroughs
3. Solve one LeetCode problem to lock it in

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Recursion & Induction

- Mathematical induction (proof technique)
- Writing recursive algorithms
- Solving recurrence relations
- Classic problems: Fibonacci, tiling a 1×n board, Tower of Hanoi, pancake sorting, merge sort, Quickselect, Karatsuba multiplication

**Focus on:**
- Writing and analyzing recursive code
- Proving correctness via induction
- Deriving time complexity from recurrences

---

### 2. Asymptotic Analysis

- Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ

- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Edit Distance
- Subset Sum
- DP on trees

**Focus on:**
- Identifying overlapping subproblems
- Defining subproblems cleanly
