# Meetups

Back to [[Conn - Overview]]

## How Meetups Work

Meetups are the core of Conn. They're how [[Conn - Groups & Genres|group]] members actually connect.

### Meetup Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| In-Person | Meet at a real location — cafe, park, gym, studio |
| Online | Video/voice call through the app or external link |
| Hybrid | Both options available for the same event |

---

## Creating a Meetup

1. Choose the group
2. Set title and description
3. Pick type (in-person / online / hybrid)
4. Set date, time, and duration
5. Add location or link
6. Set max attendees (optional)
7. Publish to group

## RSVP Flow

- **Going** - Confirmed
- **Maybe** - Interested
- **Can't make it** - Pass

Members get reminders before the meetup.

---

## After the Meetup

- Host or attendees can post an **Event Recap** as a [[Conn - Posts & Accomplishments|post]]
- Attendees can star the meetup
- Photos/highlights from the meetup show in the group feed

---

## Ideas
- Recurring meetups (weekly, monthly)
- Waitlist for full events
- Location suggestions based on group genre
- Ice-breaker prompts for first-time attendees
