## Posts

Members can create posts within their [[Conn - Groups & Genres|groups]]. Posts are how people share with the community.

### Post Types

- **Update** - General sharing (text, photo, link)
- **Accomplishment** - A milestone or win worth celebrating
- **Question** - Ask the group something
- **Event Recap** - Summary after a [[Conn - Meetups|meetup]]

## Accomplishments

Accomplishments are special posts that highlight personal wins. They get extra visibility.

### Examples
- "Just ran my first 5k!"
- "Shipped my first app to the App Store"
- "Finished my oil painting series"
- "Hit a 315 deadlift PR"

## Stars

Stars are the recognition system. Any member can give a star to a post.

- **1 star** = acknowledgement
- **5+ stars** = highlighted in the group
- **Top starred posts** show up on [[Conn - User Profiles|user profiles]]

### Star Ideas
- Weekly/monthly top posts
- Star streaks for consistent contributors
- Genre-wide leaderboards (opt-in)

## Feed

Each group has a feed of posts sorted by:
1. Recent
2. Most starred
3. Accomplishments only

## Ideas
- Reactions beyond stars (claps, fire, etc.)
- Pinned posts by admins
- Post templates per genre
